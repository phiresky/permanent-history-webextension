Both Chrome and Firefox delete or corrupt the browser history intentionally.

This extension stores the browsing history in a separate database that is never truncated.

-   Chrome deletes everything after 3 months. This is not configurable. Seriously? I've often tried to find a website again that I know I visited, but Chrome has deleted the visit.
-   Firefox: By default all history is also deleted after a short time period, although this is somewhat configurable in about:config. Firefox overrides meta information on every new visit. For example if the title changes on the second visit, the title at the old visit is overridden. I'm not actually sure if changing the about:config values at least prevents old visits from being deleted.

# Project State

This extension is currently incomplete and broken.
